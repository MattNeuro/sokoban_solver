Sokoban is a game based test, used to quantify the capabilities of an intelligent agent. The simple rules, and high complexity, make it a perfect fit for usage in artificial intelligence applications. This paper describes the implementation of a Sokoban puzzle solver using various single-agent search algorithms, augmented with a set of heuristics to reduce the size of the search tree.

The discussed techniques are: depth-first search, breadth-first search, iterative-deepening search, best-first search, a Genetic Algorithm and a push based solver. The heuristics involved depended mostly on the Manhattan distance between player and boxes, and boxes and goals.
The methods were tested on a large set of maps, showing that in general the BestFS algorithm outperforms other search methods.\\
