\section{Related Research}
Popular research on the actual Sokoban problem itself is limited to roughly the past two decades. However, Sokoban is a P-space complete problem \cite{culberson1999sokoban}, similar on an abstract level to for example the game of Go, which has been researched for at least three decades \cite{lichtenstein1980go}. Most of the context and research in this field has thus been well defined, and little more can be added to it without extensive knowledge of the theoretical foundations underlaying problems of this complexity.

Our research has therefore focused on comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of previous research. We consider solutions based on enhancing general single-agent search \cite{junghanns2001sokoban}, optimized Depth First Search \cite{nishihara2004depth}, Best First Search \cite{korf1993linear} and Genetic Algorithms \cite{goldberg1989genetic}. In addition, shared components for these solutions are based on work in intelligent path-finding \cite{stout1996smart} to generate the essential heuristics.

In setting out to compare these solutions it is important to note that they are highly dependent on implementation. As such, the proposed results may also reflect the ability for external researchers to duplicate the algorithms in question, rather than their objective performance. We invite the original authors to consider our research and update our results for the given maps if these prove to be unrepresentative.
